# Durandal Inc.

Durandal Inc. focuses on building libraries, frameworks and tools for open web technologies. Below is a list of our current projects:

* **[DurandalJS 2.x](http://durandaljs.com/)** is a cross-device, cross-platform client framework written in JavaScript and designed to make Single Page Applications (SPAs) easy to create and maintain. It is built on top of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) & [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/). More information can be found on the [official web site](http://durandaljs.com/) or in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BlueSpire/Durandal).

* **[Durandal Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/)** is a next generation Single Page Application (SPA) platform. It is the successor to DurandalJS 2.x and is written from the ground up for the modern web. *If you are starting work on a new application, this is the framework you want to use.* More information can be found on the [official web site](http://www.aurelia.io/) or at the [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/aurelia). If you have questions, we invite you to join us on [our Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/aurelia/discuss).
